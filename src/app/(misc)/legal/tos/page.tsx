                        <strong>10.5. Miscellaneous.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of
                        law to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the legality, validity, and enforceability of the
                        remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be affected or impaired thereby and the illegal,
                        invalid, or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified such that it is legal, valid, and
                        enforceable and accomplishes the intention of the parties to the fullest extent possible. The
                        failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement, unless waived in writing by
                        such party, will not constitute a waiver of that party’s right to enforce that provision or any
                        other provision of this Agreement. IN THE EVENT ANY REMEDY HEREUNDER IS DETERMINED TO HAVE
                        FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, ALL LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES SET
                        FORTH HEREIN SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW. This Agreement is
                        made and entered into for the sole protection and benefit of the parties hereto, no other person
                        or entity shall be a direct or indirect beneficiary of nor shall have any direct or indirect
                        cause of action or claim in connection with this Agreement. The enumeration herein of specific
                        remedies shall not be exclusive of any other remedies. Any delay or failure by any party to this
                        Agreement to exercise any right, power, remedy or privilege herein contained, or now or
                        hereafter existing under any applicable statute or law, shall not be construed to be a waiver of
                        such right, power, remedy or privilege, nor to limit the exercise of such right, power, remedy,
                        or privilege, nor shall it preclude the further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
                        right, power, remedy or privilege. This Agreement supersedes all prior discussions,
                        understandings and agreements with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may only be
                        modified by Pyro as set forth in the fourth paragraph of this Agreement, or by the parties in a
                        writing signed by both parties.

                    <div>
                        Servers are provided with a baseline amount of storage necessary to run the server. We do not
                        typically limit the amount of storage you can use, but we reserve the right to limit the amount
                        of storage you can use if we determine that your storage usage is excessive. Excessive use of
                        storage is determined by the effect it has on the performance of the server and the average
                        storage usage of other users. Thus, this policy exists as a method of protecting other users,
                        not as a method of explicitly limiting your storage usage.

                        period system.

                        panel) to request a refund. We reserve the right to limit the number of refunds you can request

                        the Services in good faith. You can also cancel your services via the same methods.

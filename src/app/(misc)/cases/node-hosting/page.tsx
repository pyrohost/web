                            it’s because they were unable to change the branding of our panel, so they just rebranded
                            themselves. It was also around this time where they banned our team from their Discord
                            server to try and hide this effort.

                            We had to contact a second accredited copyright lawyer. The first lawyer was able to
                            accelerate our Discord DMCA takedown request, but was unable to strke the YouTube video.
                            This was the second lawyer's response to the YouTube matter:
                        </p>
                        <img
                            className='my-4 rounded-md'

                        />
                        <p>
                            We decided to take their legal advice and ignore this video and report it for it's blatant
                            impersonation of our brand.

                            One of our staff members translated a staff members' conversation from the fake "Pyro
                            Hosting | 24/7" Discord server. We believe it to be in response to the YouTube DMCA, but the
                            translation is rough at best.
